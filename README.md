## Hi there, I'm NewGen2022 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate full-stack developer and tech enthusiast, always eager to learn and explore new technologies. I enjoy building dynamic and scalable applications, focusing on both frontend and backend development.

Currently, I'm diving into building modern web applications.

As for future plans, I want to enhance my skills in system administration, focusing on server management and security. I also aim to learn cross-platform mobile development and machine learning.

In addition to my development work, I enjoy solving cybersecurity challenges and continuously improving my skills. I'm also dedicated to learning and improving my English to better communicate and collaborate with others.
